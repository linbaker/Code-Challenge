# Lindsey Baker Code Challenge

Language Agnostic Code Challenge for GTS Enigineering

## Description

Node.js class that will take in a large string and return the count of how often three word phrases are repeated in the text. 

I did not get to implement accepting a JSON request. This branch contains the base functionality of transforming the recieved text. I will include the branch containing my intitial work setting up my Express server and request/response handling. 

#### Known Limitations

Currently, text containing less than 3 words or empty text will return an 'undefined' response. With more time, I would handle this within my Express controller. 
There is also no handling for invalid inputs or parameters. 


### Dependencies

* NPM
* Express
* Jest

### Executing program

* Run test suite with `npm test`
